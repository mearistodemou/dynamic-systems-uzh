Description: Meet Kirki, my dog, who has been scratching compulsively and has irritated (red) skin. I call a vet over who takes a look at her and tells me that this looks like an allergic reaction, which 80% of the time is a response to some proteins. So, she needs to get on an elimination diet to get rid of the allergens. I buy this (very expensive) food and start Kirki on her new diet. She happily eats it (she will eat just about anything). But a week later, I notice that her itch gets worse and her skin is even more irritated. Just as I’m thinking of calling the vet, Kirki happily places her snout on the couch and drops a flower petal. I go out to the balcony and notice that she’s been secretly snacking on the lavender plant! Which is toxic for dogs (can cause skin irriation, itching etc.). So, then I remove the lavender plant and continue the diet. But while walking Kirki, I notice that a dog owner throws snacks on the ground to incentivize their old dog to move during their walks. Of course, Kirki has at times been indulging in these free snacks during our walks.

Decision: I need to decide if I can trust the results of this elimination diet. The diet evaluation deadline is due in a week.
